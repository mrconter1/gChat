# gChat: My 2020 Exploration of a ChatGPT-like System

#### Created: July 28, 2020 (2+ Years Before ChatGPT's Release)

## Repository Description
gChat: My personal experiment from 2020 exploring how to build a ChatGPT-like conversational AI system, over 2 years before ChatGPT's public release.

## Overview

In July 2020, I embarked on a personal project to explore the potential of creating a ChatGPT-like conversational AI system. This repository, gChat, represents my early attempts at building an interactive AI chat interface using OpenAI's GPT models, more than two years before ChatGPT was introduced to the world.

### Historical Context

- **gChat Created**: July 28, 2020
- **ChatGPT Released**: November 30, 2022

This project showcases my curiosity and foresight in exploring AI-driven conversations long before they became a global phenomenon.

## Project Goals

1. Experiment with integrating OpenAI's GPT models into a web application
2. Create a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with AI
3. Explore the potential of AI-powered conversational systems
4. Learn about the challenges and possibilities in building such systems

## Features

- Web-based chat interface
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT models (davinci engine)
- Real-time AI responses
- Conversation history maintenance
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Technical Implementation

- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap
- AI Integration: OpenAI API

## Reflections

This project was an exciting journey into the world of AI-powered conversations. It helped me understand the potential and limitations of language models at the time, and looking back, it's fascinating to see how close this experiment was to what would later become widely known as ChatGPT.
